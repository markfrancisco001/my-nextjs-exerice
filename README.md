1. Overview of the Solution
    -This project provides a solution for managing user-generated content. It focuses on the following:

    #Storing content securely in a Supabase database.
    #Allowing users to post content and interact with it via commenting.

2. Architecture
    -The architecture is designed to separate backend and frontend concerns efficiently:

    #Frontend: Built using Next.js with TypeScript. It handles UI interactions and makes API calls to interact with the backend.
    #Backend: The content is stored in Supabase (a hosted PostgreSQL database) for easy integration with authentication and data management.
    #User Authentication: Managed via Supabase, where users authenticate and are linked to their posts.

3. Approach and Methodology
    -The approach taken for this solution includes:

    1. Data Management:

    #Post content and comments are stored in the Supabase database.
    Each post is linked to the user who created it, allowing for personalized content management.
    
    2. Frontend Handling:

    #React (Next.js) components manage the user interface, including forms for content creation and comment submission.
    The UI is interactive and updates dynamically upon successful form submission (without a page refresh).
    
    3. State Management:

    #React's useState and useEffect hooks are used to manage the application state, such as loading states, posts, and comments.
    
    4. Error Handling and Feedback:

    #Toast notifications are used to inform users about successful actions or errors (e.g., when posting content or adding comments).
